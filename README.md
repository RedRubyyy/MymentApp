# MymentApp

Hello everyone, I made a CRUD / Rest Full API website application with Tech
Express, and MongoDB as the database. As for the UI, I used Boostrap 5 
to make it easier to create utility styles.

MymentApp is an application website that provides several 
interfaces for financial administration, including an admin dashboard 
and client table to allow clients to see how much money they have.

I don't intend to host this project because secure hosting services 
require quite a lot of money to use the service.
